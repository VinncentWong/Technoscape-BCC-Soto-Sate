# Technoscape-BCC-Soto-Sate

My Spend is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 11 newer): 
  
  
 ``` 
 git clone(https://github.com/VinncentWong/Technoscape-BCC-Soto-Sate.git) 
 cd spring-Technoscape-BCC-Soto-Sate 
 ./mvnw package 
 java -jar target/*.jar 
 ``` 
  
 You can then access My Spend here http://localhost:8080/
